# Formula 1 data visualization project
This project contains a stand-alone website that can be viewed using any basic webserver.
The webserver is required since the website uses AJAX requests to load the data provided in the `data` folder of this project.

## How to use
* Clone this repository anywhere you want
* Use `run.sh` to launch the SimpleHTTPServer provided by python2 (or use any other webserver you like)
* Point your browser to http://localhost:8000 (or where your webserver lives) and enjoy the view.

## Where did you get the data?
We got the data from http://ergast.com/mrd/ (Thanks a lot to the beautiful people running that website!)
